## R1: Description of Website

### Purpose

The purpose of our application, TikTalk, is to allow users to communicate with one-another in a fast, efficient manner.

**Functionality/Features**

- Chat history
- User avatars
- File/Image uploads
- Download chat history

**Target Audience**

The TikTalk development team believes in building applications for everyone. Although we firmly believe that anyone can use our application and we aim to make it as accessible as possible, the typical end-user will probably be between the ages of 20 - 40 years old, and have good taste in chat applications. It will be free to use and likely to suit university students, families, colleagues, and friends alike!
